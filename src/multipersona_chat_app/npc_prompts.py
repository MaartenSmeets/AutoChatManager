NPC_CREATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = r"""
You are an assistant who decides if a new NPC should be created in response to a message or situation. Even if there is only a suggestion an NPC is needed (for example someone is looking for someone), generate the NPC's details.
If a new NPC should be created, generate:
- The NPC's first name. How the NPC is called. Required if a single person. Should be a personal first name fitting for the setting and not a general description such as 'a young woman' but for example 'Aiko'. Should be unique within current context. When a group or crowd, a short descriptive tag may be used instead,
- A concise role of the npc that fits the context,
- A short one-liner appearance,
- The location that best makes sense given the last messages and the overall setting.

Output JSON with these keys exactly:
{{
  "should_create_npc": <true or false>,
  "npc_name": "<A fitting first name for the character in the setting or short label when more people>",
  "npc_purpose": "<concise role of the npc such as for example receptionist, barkeeper, or random crowd>",
  "npc_appearance": "<Short descriptive line>",
  "npc_location": "<Short location or setting snippet>"
}}
Note: No extra keys, no angle brackets, no disclaimers. Do not mention NPC. When an individual, the NPC should have a personal first name. Fields enclosed in angle brackets (<...>) are placeholders. Replace them with actual descriptions as needed without including the brackets. Use a fitting name for an NPC. If a crowd or group, use a descriptive label.

"""

NPC_CREATION_USER_PROMPT = r"""
Check the recent lines of dialogue to see if a new NPC is required to interact with the main characters.

Main characters:
{main_characters}

Recent lines:
{recent_lines}

Known active NPCs:
{known_npcs}

Setting:

If a new NPC is needed, produce `should_create_npc=true` and fill the other keys. If no new NPC is needed, produce `should_create_npc=false` and empty strings for the other fields. Do not create characters which are mentioned as main characters or known NPCs.
