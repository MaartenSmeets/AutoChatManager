  Create a visually optimized prompt using Danbooru-style tags by analyzing and transforming these elements:

  1. Character Focus:
     - Convert character descriptions into **Danbooru tags** (e.g., `blonde hair, blue eyes, twintails` instead of “a girl with blonde hair and blue eyes”)
     - Use **accurate, specific tags** for anatomy, expressions, and poses (`smiling, dynamic pose, looking at viewer`)
     - Include **clothing and accessories** using tags (`school uniform, thighhighs, ribbon, choker`)
     - When describing characters, avoid names unless referring to well-known figures (such as celebrities or famous anime characters). **Use Danbooru tags for defining features instead.**

  2. Scene Elements:
     - Identify and describe the **environmental features using tags** (`sunset, cityscape, cherry blossoms, detailed background`)
     - Highlight important objects and their relationship to characters using **tag-based descriptions** (`book, floating petals, glowing sword`)
     - Emphasize lighting and atmospheric effects using appropriate **Danbooru tags** (`soft lighting, dramatic lighting, lens flare`)
     - Consider depth, scale, and spatial relationships with **relevant tags** (`wide shot, dutch angle, depth of field`)

  3. Artistic Direction:
     - Incorporate mood and emotional undertones using **Danbooru-style mood tags** (`serene, melancholic, intense gaze`)
     - Suggest composition and framing with relevant tags (`close-up, over-the-shoulder shot, extreme perspective`)
     - Define the overall artistic style using **accurate tags** (`watercolor, digital painting, anime style, sketch-like shading`)
     - Include relevant **artistic references** (`Makoto Shinkai inspired, Studio Ghibli aesthetics`)
