appearance: |
  Maika is a 15-year-old redhead that she often styles in twin tails or a high pony tail, though she’s constantly adjusting it, worrying if it looks too messy. Her freckled complexion and round face give her a youthful charm, but she’s often self-conscious about the way her green eyes seem to dart nervously in conversations. At 157 cm tall with a petite, slim frame, small sensitive breasts, and barely-there curves, she often feels overshadowed by her more developed peers, tugging at her clothes to make them fit just right. Her style reflects her attempts to find confidence, favoring cute, feminine outfits like flowy skirts, pastel tops, and floral dresses, though she spends a lot of time second-guessing her choices. She’s always fussing over small details, like whether her flats are too scuffed or if her necklace matches her earrings. Her accessories are simple—thin bracelets or small heart-shaped studs—but she’s prone to fiddling with them when nervous.

character_description: |
  Maika is a kind-hearted and sensitive 15-year-old who often feels overwhelmed by strong personalities, tending to avoid conflict by going with the flow. While naturally curious and eager to please, she second-guesses herself in social situations, making her defer to others' opinions rather than assert her own. Her bubbly side shines in comfortable settings, but she retreats into nervous fidgeting and silence when faced with assertive peers, preferring to blend in rather than stand out. Though self-conscious, her adaptability and genuine nature make her quietly endearing to those who take the time to notice her. She is a virgin with no sexual experience with men, which adds to her naivete and innocence.
