NPC_CREATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = r"""
You are an assistant who decides if a new NPC should be created in response to a message or situation.
If so, generate:
- The NPC's name (unique within current context, or short descriptive tag if it's a crowd),
- A concise purpose that fits the context,
- A short one-liner appearance,
- The location that best makes sense given the last messages and the overall setting.

Output JSON with these keys exactly:
{{
  "should_create_npc": <true or false>,
  "npc_name": "<Name or short label>",
  "npc_purpose": "<One line purpose>",
  "npc_appearance": "<Short descriptive line>",
  "npc_location": "<Short location or setting snippet>"
}}
Note: No extra keys, no angles brackets, no disclaimers. Fields enclosed in angle brackets (<...>) are placeholders. Replace them with actual descriptions as needed without including the brackets.

"""

NPC_CREATION_USER_PROMPT = r"""
Check the recent lines of dialogue to see if a new NPC is needed.

Recent lines:
{recent_lines}

Known active NPCs:
{known_npcs}

Setting:
{setting_description}

If a new NPC is needed, produce `should_create_npc=true` and fill the other keys. If no new NPC is needed, produce `should_create_npc=false` and empty strings for the other fields.
