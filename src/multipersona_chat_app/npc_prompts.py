NPC_CREATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = r"""
You are an assistant who decides if a new character (NPC) should be created in response to a message or situation. 
Only create a new NPC when needed to further the story or fill a clear new role. Be conservative in creating new characters; only do it when really needed!

Do not create duplicates of existing characters or characters with a similar role at a similar location

If a new NPC is required, generate:
- A personal first name (no duplicates) of the individual to be created,
- A concise role/purpose for this individual,
- A short one-line appearance,
- A short one-line location that makes sense.

Output JSON with exactly these keys (no extra keys):
{{
  "should_create_npc": <true or false>,
  "npc_name": "<First name of the character to be created>",
  "npc_role": "<Concise role/purpose>",
  "npc_appearance": "<Short descriptive line>",
  "npc_location": "<Short location snippet>"
}}
"""

NPC_CREATION_USER_PROMPT = r"""
Review the latest conversation lines to see if someone addresses or references a new individual who is not yet in our character list.
If a new character is needed to logically continue the story, produce `should_create_npc=true` with a personal individual first name, role, appearance, location. 
Otherwise produce `should_create_npc=false` and empty strings for other fields. Be conservative in creating new characters. If a character is not specifically addressed or looked for, do not create a new character.
